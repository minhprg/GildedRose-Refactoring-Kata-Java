# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-Java
This is my implementation of [GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) in Java.

## How to compile and run the code

### Import using IDE
The project itself is a Maven project, therefore:
- If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you could follow [this instruction](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html) to import the project
- If you are using Eclipse, you could follow [this instruction](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/EclipseMavenInt.html)

After you've imported it to your IDE, you can simple hit the compile button.

If you prefer to compile from the command line, you should firstly [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). After that you can go to the project directory and type:

```java
mvn install
```

Et voila! The project is compiled.
